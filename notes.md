# Notes

- Document/Segment IDs from content hash?
  - This makes documents and segments unique (pro?)
  - Make links reference to their linker
  - How to tell linker workers which documents to process? Don't tell?
  - How to restrain certain documents to their user/case/whatever (do we want that?)
- Link Search could query the list of documents (probably paginated) and once a link is found, first traverse the tree of the found object to find other close links
